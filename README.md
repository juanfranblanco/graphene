Intro for new developers
------------------------

This is a quick introduction to get new developers up to speed on Graphene.

Starting Graphene
-----------------

    git clone https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene
    cd graphene
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
    make
    ./programs/witness_node/witness_node

This will launch the witness node. If you would like to launch the command-line wallet, you must first specify a port for communication with the witness node. To do this, add text to `witness_node_data_dir/config.json` as follows, then restart the node:

    "websocket_endpoint": "127.0.0.1:8090"

Then, in a separate terminal window, start the command-line wallet `cli_wallet`:

    ./programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet

If you send private keys over this connection, `websocket_endpoint` should be bound to localhost for security.

Code coverage testing

Unit testing

Core mechanics
--------------

- Witnesses
- Key members
- Price feeds
- Global parameters
- Voting on witnesses
- Voting on key members
- Witness pay
- Transfers
- Markets
- Escrow
- Recurring payments

Gotchas
-------

- Key objects can actually contain a key or address

Witness node
------------

The role of the witness node is to broadcast transactions, download blocks, and optionally sign them.

TODO:  How do you get block signing keys into the witness node?

How to use fc async to do recurring tasks
-----------------------------------------

    _my_task = fc::async( callable, "My Task" );
    _my_task = fc::schedule( callable, "My Task 2", exec_time );

Stuff to know about the code
----------------------------

`static_variant<t1, t2>` is a *union type* which says "this variable may be either t1 or t2."  It is serializable if t1 and t2 are both serializable.

The file `operations.hpp` documents the available operations, and `database_fixture.hpp` is a good reference for building and submitting transactions for processing.

Tests also show the way to do many things, but are often cluttered with code that generates corner cases to try to break things in every possible way.

Visitors are at the end of `operations.hpp` after the large typedef for `operation` as a `static_variant`.  TODO:  They should be refactored into a separate header.

Downcasting stuff
-----------------

- You have an `object_id_type` and want to downcast it to a `key_id_type` : `key_id_type( object_id )`
- You have an `operation_result` and want to downcast it to an `object_id_type` : `op_result.get<object_id_type>()`
- Since `operation_result` is a `static_variant`, the above is also how you downcast `static_variant`

Running specific tests
----------------------

- `tests/chain_tests -t block_tests/name_of_test`

Debugging FC exceptions with GDB
--------------------------------

- `catch throw`

Questions
---------------

- Is there a way to generate help with parameter names and method descriptions?

    Yes. Documentation of the code base, including APIs, can be generated using Doxygen. Simply run `doxygen` in this directory.

- Is there a way to allow external program to drive `cli_wallet` via websocket, JSONRPC, or HTTP?

    Yes. External programs may connect to the CLI wallet and make its calls over a websockets API. To do this, run the wallet in
    server mode, i.e. `cli_wallet -s "127.0.0.1:9999"` and then have the external program connect to it over the specified port
    (in this example, port 9999).
